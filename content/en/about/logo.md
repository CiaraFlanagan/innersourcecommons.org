The [InnerSource Commons logo](/images/logo-big.png) is a swirling, white-and-black vortex with the front part in the rough shape of the letter "I" (for InnerSource).
It is licensed under `<INSERT LICENSE HERE>`, which means that you can modify and reuse it for your purposes.
An easy way to modify the logo is to replace the white parts of the vortex with a color scheme that is specific to your company or event.
Just open the logo in a standard paint program and use the color fill feature to dump your desired color into the white sections.
