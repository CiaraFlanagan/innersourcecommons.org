The InnerSource Commons (ISC) is the world's largest community of InnerSource practitioners, who have come together with the goal of creating and sharing knowledge about InnerSource. You can join the community on **[slack](https://join.slack.com/t/innersourcecommons/shared_invite/zt-1htfuq036-Uq22qnDHA6kydBvk_C5PUw).**

We come together at our summits to learn and share experiences. Join us there to...

- Hear about global trends in InnerSource.
- Learn from others who are on the journey of InnerSource adoption.
- Share your own experience and meet like-minded people, all of who are passionate about making InnerSource a success within their respective organizations.

The InnerSource Commons ([InnerSourceCommons.org](http://innersourcecommons.org)) aka ISC is a consortium of representatives from over 500 companies and institutions. It utilizes open source methods to provide organizations pursuing inner sourcing a forum for discussing and improving the practice of InnerSource through the sharing of experiences (under the [Chatham House Rule](https://www.chathamhouse.org/about/chatham-house-rule)), creation and review of InnerSource patterns, and the open exchange of ideas.

### [Code of Conduct](/about/codeofconduct/)

All participants, vendors, and guests at InnerSource Commons events are required to abide by the [code of conduct](/about/codeofconduct/).
All related conversations in the InnerSource Slack Channel will still be considered to fall under [Chatham House Rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule): information discussed can be shared but not attributed.
